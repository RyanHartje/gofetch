GOLD
===

GOLD (Go Logical Description) is a Go based CMS that also uses MySQL, and ships with an opionated Kubernetes manifest and helm chart to aide in deployment.

Gold was born out of a frustration with options for CMS. Most current CMSes do not provide a clean and easy way to manage single page apps or landing pages that create a modern aethestic within a short time frame. 

The goal of gold is to be able to implement either Bootstrap or Foundation with a limited number of front-end frameworks in a way that works out of the box. An end user upon deployment should be able to login, and edit the logo, hero image if configured, the call to action text, and body contents, and have a professional looking web experience within a short time frame.
